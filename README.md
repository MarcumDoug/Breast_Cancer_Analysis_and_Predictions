# Breast Cancer Analysis and Predictions  

## Overview
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in women, but outcomes have been shown to improve if caught and treated early. Mammogram screenings are an excellent tool in identifying a potential tumorous mass, even before symptoms may appear. While imaging technology has increased resolution and clarity, interpretation of the data and the image as still exposed to potential false positive or false negative findings by breast imaging radiologists. Can predictive analytics be used to hone and improve cancerous tumor diagnosis? Data from the "Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database" was analyzed and ran through four predictive classifier models. The findings of this analysis show that through machine learning, machines can diagnosis breast cancer at a highly effective rate. In doing so, it will be another tool in the arsenal of early detection and minimizing the damaging effects of the disease.
